Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.


# Overview
The purpose of this data analysis is to identify key ride sharing metrics by type of city and create a graphical representation of the total weekly fares based on the city types. This will help improve access to ride sharing services and determine ride affordability.


# Results

We can see that rural cities had the highest average fare per driver and ride while urban cities had the lowest.

As shown in the graph, urban cities had higher total fare followed by suburban cities while the rural cities had the lowest total fare. 


# Recommendation
I would recommend obtaining more information about the demographics of those living in the the three city types and the five previous years of city and ride data.

We could use the demographic information such as population and age range, to group the fares by age and city type for example.
